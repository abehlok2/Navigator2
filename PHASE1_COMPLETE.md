# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Implemented Functionality

- Authentication UI with automatic registration fallback and persistent session storage.
- Protected routing for Home and Session pages with role-aware greetings.
- Room lifecycle controls for facilitators (create) and explorers (join with password).
- Shared signaling client with reconnection handling and participant roster synchronization.
- Session dashboard showing role-specific panels, live connection status badge, and participant list with online indicators.

## Verified Working Scenarios

- End-to-end login and redirect to protected Home page.
- Facilitator room creation with optional password and automatic population of join form.
- Explorer room join flow validating room ID/password and navigating to Session view.
- WebSocket connection status transitions (connected, connecting during disruption, disconnected on teardown).
- Participant roster updates when users join or leave the session.
- Leave Room and Logout flows returning users to the appropriate screens and clearing session state.
- TypeScript compilation via `npm run build`.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- No automated end-to-end tests; execution requires manual verification using the provided script.
- Background audio, WebRTC media streams, and advanced facilitator controls are placeholders for future phases.
- Error messaging mirrors backend responses and may need refinement once server error codes stabilize.
- Session reconnect testing is manual; additional instrumentation may be required for flaky network environments.

## Ready for Phase 2

- Shared signaling client infrastructure with hooks for RTC offer/answer/candidate events.
- Session layout with panels ready for audio controls and media routing logic.
- Participant store management supporting presence updates, suitable for integrating media tracks.
- Documented manual test script (`scripts/phase1-critical-path.md`) for regression coverage.
